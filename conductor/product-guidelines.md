# Product Guidelines: V-Vortex

## Voice and Tone
*   **Professional & Encouraging:** Communication should be clear, direct, and supportive.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Instructions for registration and team management should be unambiguous.
*   **Supportive:** Provide helpful feedback during the OTP and invitation processes.

## Visual Identity
*   **Preserve Existing Aesthetic:** Maintain the current "Vortex" theme as established in the codebase (e.g., `vortex.css`).
*   **Dark Mode Foundation:** Continue using the dark background aesthetic with themed accents.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure new components (like dashboards and forms) align with the established visual language of the landing page and preloader.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Security First:** Emphasize the passwordless, OTP-based authentication for ease and safety.
*   **Zero-Friction Onboarding:** Minimize steps for team leaders to create teams and for members to join via invite.
*   **Clear State Feedback:** Use distinct visual cues (spinners, success/error messages) for all Supabase interactions (login, invite sent, profile saved).
*   **Mobile-First approach:** Ensure registration and dashboards are fully functional and readable on mobile devices.
